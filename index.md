## Sounds

### Albums

#### twenty sixteen

A selection of sketches recorded in the first half of 2016, narrowed down from a larger roughly-one-track-per-week collection. Many edited down from living room improvisations with a mixer, a laptop, and a controller. One recorded on the bus, one in bed before going to sleep.

#### Lunai Lisma

A collection of tracks recorded roughly when I was living in the Middle East. Roughly recorded samples and fuzzy synths.
